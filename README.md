# Next.js 15 Link Component Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the `next/link` component in Next.js 15.  The issue stems from changes in how Next.js handles client-side routing and the `Link` component's interaction with it. 

## Bug Description:

In Next.js 15, the `next/link` component may exhibit unexpected behavior if not used correctly, such as throwing errors, failing to navigate properly, or causing incorrect URL generation.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the behavior of the link in the browser (potentially error in console).

## Solution:

The provided `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a potential fix or updated usage pattern for resolving the described issues.  Changes might include upgrading dependencies, refactoring the link usage to align with Next.js 15's new routing mechanisms, using `next/navigation`'s `useRouter` for more direct control, or adding other configurations.
